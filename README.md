This Java project is a Student Grade Management System designed to demonstrate core object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and basic file handling in Java. The application allows users to manage student information, calculate grades based on marks, and display results in a clear and structured format.
The project is divided into multiple classes to maintain proper separation of concerns. The Student class stores student details such as name, roll number, and marks. The GradeCalculator class contains the logic required to calculate grades based on the student’s total or average score. The FileHandler class is responsible for handling file-related operations such as saving or reading student data, making the application more practical and closer to real-world usage. The MainApp class acts as the entry point of the program and controls the overall execution flow.
This project is ideal for beginners who want to understand how multiple Java classes interact with each other in a real application. It also helps in learning how to structure a Java project, use methods effectively, and display output using the console. Overall, this system provides a simple yet effective example of applying Java programming fundamentals in an organized manner.
